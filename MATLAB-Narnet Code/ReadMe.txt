Steps to run the code:
Take pabc06 as an example.

1.Copy the file(network_test.mat) which is the trained neural network into the folder "code" to replace the original file(also named network_test.mat) in the folder.
2.Double click the file(predict.m) in the folder "code" to open the file using MATLAB.
3.Change the parameters in the file(predict.m). The paremeters can be found in the file "/Networks&Parameters in predict.m/pabc06/06.txt".
 There are 6 parameters need to be changed in the first module of the code(which have been commented with "change parameter"). 
4.Run the code and you will see the figure including predicted lines.



Train_combined.m file is used to train the  neural network.
